## Clues and Hints
1. "Just search it" - Direct instruction to search
2. "The spirit of Open Source" - Refers to open source intelligence gathering
3. "things never truly disappear online" - Suggests using web archives or deleted content recovery

3. Look for deleted commits or branches in repositories
4. Search for cached versions of the CTF website
